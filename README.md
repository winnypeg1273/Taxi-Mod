# Taxi-Mod
This is a new &amp; improved taxi ride mod for GTA San Andreas (not entirely mine)

## Legacy Version
It is originally uploaded by Sarafsuhail

### Known issues
It sometimes causes the player to remain ignored by police after the trip ends

## Goals for my new version
* Fixes all the mentioned bugs
* Handles various trip interruption cases such as: car damaged, taxi driver got out
* The mod now properly checks if the player actually has enough money to start the trip, or else the player will get out of the car
* It also checks if the destination is within an unlocked region or city
* The taxi only operates within a certain distance. If the player finds it in a city, then it only operates within the city's limit.
